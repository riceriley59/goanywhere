# GoAnywhere

This project aims to allow for multi-language support of your go libraries that you may be writing.

It allows you to write libraries which can support the strong-typing  and clean interfaces that go natively supports and thrives at. You can write automation tools for example and then use the library in your python or bash automation scripts.
